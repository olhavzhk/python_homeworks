# Write a program that reads in a sequence of characters, and determines whether it's parentheses, braces, and curly brackets are "balanced."
# Make sure to test your code as follows:
# () balanced
# ()) not balanced
# )( not balanced
# ([]) balanced
# ([{}]) balanced
# ([{]}) not balanced
# [(){}[]]() balanced
# Try to make the simplest solution, usually for this, Stack would be the easiest way.
